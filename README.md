# Multirotor on an FPGA
Welcome to the X8_multirotor project. If you are looking to immediately get started flying, see "Fly Now". If you are wanting to modify this project, take a look at "Getting to Work".

## Fly Now
To get started flying now, You must have the exact parts in the same physical configuration we used. If your system is in any way different, you must modify the project to suit your system. If everything is the same follow these steps:
1. Copy the X8 bit stream, X8 tcl file, and X8 Jupyter notebook to your PYNQ-Z1 board.
2. Power on the X8 multirotor and open the X8 Jupyter notebook
2. Run the X8 Jupyter notebook to configure the drone and start the HLS IP cores
3. Perform the [Flight Checks](https://github.com/...)
6. Take care and fly safely

## Getting to Work
If you want to start working and adding to this project, you first need Vivado Design suite V2018.2 with the ZYNQ 7020 SoC part installed. You must also clone this repo into your pynq board or Windows PC for editing. Follow the steps in ["Getting Started"](https://github.com/jofranco/multi-rotor-on-FPGA/wiki/Getting-Started).
