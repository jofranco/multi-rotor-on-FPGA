Phase 20 Post Router Timing
INFO: [Route 35-62] Timer settings changed to match sign-off timing analysis. Setup and Hold analysis on slow, fast Corners with nearest common node skew is enabled.
INFO: [Route 35-20] Post Routing Timing Summary | WNS=-0.262 | TNS=-1.775 | WHS=0.017  | THS=0.000  |

CRITICAL WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.
